          <h2>J. R. CARPENTER || A Handmade Web
</h2>

                Quote I found worthwhile:

In "Media Archaeology: Method and Machine versus History and Narrative of Media" (2011) Wolfgang Ernst observes: "If a radio from a museum collection is reactivated to play broadcast channels of the present, it changes its status: it is not a historical object anymore but actively generates sensual and informational presence."

We can yearn for the early web all we want, and we can easily create projects that mimic the aesthetics and the functionality of sites from back then. However, we’ll never get to have the exact feel of the sites because the world we live in today is so vastly different from back then, and we have sites all around us that remind us of how the web is today. People on the web back in the day lacked that comparison, and I imagine that their experiences with the web were much more freeing and exciting than what we have today. 
<br><br>
This isn’t to say that we shouldn’t learn lessons from old sites and carry values and mindsets from the handmade web into our own sites, but I think it’s worthwhile being thoughtful about why. IS it just for nostalgia, yearning for another, simpler time period? Or is there real merit?

New words i learned:
<br><br>
Brogue: a strong outdoor shoe with ornamental perforated patterns in the leather.                
<br>
Idiosyncratic: having strange or unusual habits, ways of behaving

It’s interesting to read some of these sorts of writings right after setting up Assistive Access on my grandmothers iPhone, a feature designed to make the device simpler and more intuitive for the elderly to understand. With all of this discussion and beratement of companies making the technologies that power our computers less accessible, I feel a lot of the arguments glaze over groups of people who are less tech savvy or have no desire to know how they function. I agree there should be an option to peek inside, but it saves a lot of time for the vast majority of the population to not have to bother or be distracted by it.
