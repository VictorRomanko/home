</h2>

                Quote I found worthwhile:

In "Media Archaeology: Method and Machine versus History and Narrative of Media" (2011) Wolfgang Ernst observes: "If a radio from a museum collection is reactivated to play broadcast channels of the present, it changes its status: it is not a historical object anymore but actively generates sensual and informational presence."

We can yearn for the early web all we want, and we can easily create projects that mimic the aesthetics and the functionality of sites from back then. However, we’ll never get to have the exact feel of the sites because the world we live in today is so vastly different from back then, and we have sites all around us that remind us of how the web is today. People on the web back in the day lacked that comparison, and I imagine that their experiences with the web were much more freeing and exciting than what we have today. 
<br><br>
This isn’t to say that we shouldn’t learn lessons from old sites and carry values and mindsets from the handmade web into our own sites, but I think it’s worthwhile being thoughtful about why. IS it just for nostalgia, yearning for another, simpler time period? Or is there real merit?

New words i learned:
<br><br>
Brogue: a strong outdoor shoe with ornamental perforated patterns in the leather.                
<br>
Idiosyncratic: having strange or unusual habits, ways of behaving
